# Image Targeting

This is a simple Vuforia image tracking app that demonstrates the usage of Vuforia SDK to track and augment virtual content onto real-world images.

## Features

- Image tracking: The app uses Vuforia's image recognition capabilities to detect and track specific target images.
- Augmented reality (AR) rendering: Once a target image is detected, the app overlays virtual content onto the real-world image, creating an augmented reality experience.
- Simple user interface: The app provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls to interact with the augmented content.

## Prerequisites

- Unity 3D: Make sure you have Unity 3D installed on your development machine.
- Vuforia SDK: Download and import the Vuforia SDK into your Unity project. You can obtain the SDK from the Vuforia Developer Portal (https://developer.vuforia.com/).

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Unity 3D.
3. Import the Vuforia SDK into the project.
4. Set up your Vuforia license key in Unity. Follow the instructions provided by Vuforia to obtain and activate your license key.
5. Configure Vuforia Image Targets: Create and configure the target images you want to track using Vuforia's Target Manager. Ensure that the target images are imported into your Unity project.
6. Adjust and customize the AR content: Modify and enhance the virtual content and user interface to suit your specific needs.

## Usage

1. Build and deploy the app on your target platform (e.g., Android, iOS).
2. Launch the app on your device.
3. Point the device's camera at a target image configured in Vuforia.
4. Watch as the app detects and tracks the target image, overlaying augmented content on top of it.
